## Overview

In this sample we will work with a SensorTag and a Rasperry Pi 3. The target is to understand the interaction between the SensorTag and the Raspbery Pi 3 via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). The Raspberry Pi 3 was chosen as it comes with an on-board Bluetooth chip.

## Requirements

In order to fully cover this tutorial we need the following setup:

* A Raspberry Pi 3
* A TI SensorTag
* WiFi or Ethernet connection to the Rapsberry Pi
* A proper OS on the Raspberry Pi 3 (incl. a C compiler and Bluetooth)
* A connection via SSH to the Raspberry Pi

We can use an editor installed on the Raspberry Pi 3, e.g., nano, ed, or vim. The tutorial uses the *Raspbian Jessie* image on the Raspberry Pi 3.
